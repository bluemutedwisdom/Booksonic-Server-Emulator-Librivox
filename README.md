# Librivox-Booksonic-API
This project will allow you to set up an API for Librivox that emulates a Booksonic server, this way you will be able to get the whole Librivox library added to your Booksonic Android app (or any Subsonic compatible app really). Please note that this SHOULD NOT BE USED at it's current state as it is not finished, untested and may contain security holes.
